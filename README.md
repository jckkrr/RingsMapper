RingsMapper
A script that creates map-like scatter plots with rings used to show the change in size over two periods. 

In this instance, a map of Autralian airport cooridinates has been used. Then, every 13th has been decide two lots of random numbers.

When mapped, the opaque ring is the starting size. Red padding shows size of decrease; black padding shows size of increase.

Graphing is done in Plotly (GO) and includes customised hover text.
